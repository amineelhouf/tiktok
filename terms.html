    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the
      <strong>Amine TikTok Automation App</strong> (“the App”), which automates
      the posting of videos to your TikTok account using TikTok’s official OAuth system.
      By authorizing the App, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed to automate uploading short Moroccan comedy videos
      that you have prepared or approved. The App operates only after you grant
      explicit OAuth permission.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must comply with TikTok’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for all videos uploaded to your account.</li>
      <li>You agree not to use the App for illegal, harmful, or infringing activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. OAuth Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      By granting access via TikTok OAuth, you allow the App to upload videos
      to your TikTok account. The App does not request permissions beyond what
      is required for video publication.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Guarantee of Service</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided “as-is” and “as-available.” We do not guarantee uptime,
      compatibility, or future support if TikTok changes its API rules.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We are not responsible for losses caused by misuse of the App.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for changes made by TikTok to its API.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for service interruptions or data loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may revoke the App’s access from your TikTok account settings at any time.
      We may suspend or terminate the App if necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Updates to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms occasionally. When updates occur, the “Last updated”
      date will change accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
